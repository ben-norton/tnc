### Title

Names for biodiversity


### Abstract

Taxonomic names are an important part of any biodiversity data infrastructure and systematic handling of taxonomic names is essential for any meaningful integration of biodiversity data. Yet, the current TDWG standard for dealing with taxonomic names, the Taxonomic Concept Transfer Schema (TCS), is barely used and there are many non-standard implementations out there.

At the ‘Names for Biodiversity’ workshop at SPNHC/TDWG 2018 the Taxonomic Names and Concepts Interest Group (TNC-IG) was reconvened in order to promote the consolidation of handling of names in biodiversity data systems. First order of business for the TNC-IG is to come up with a replacement of TCS that better foresees in the needs for taxonomic names and concepts of the biodiversity data community and is compliant with the TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance and Standards Documentation Standards.

At this workshop we will present and review the draft new specification, as well as use cases and auxiliary documents. We will also discuss and prioritise further needs and create a work plan for the interest group for the coming year.
