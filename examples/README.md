# Examples

This folder will be used to collate examples to illustrate how taxonomic data is
dealt with in different scenarios. This will be rather messy in the beginning,
but we'll clean it up and make it more consistent as we go.

## Index

- [NSL instance graph example](https://github.com/tdwg/tnc/blob/master/TDWG2018/nsl-instancegraph-example.pdf)

- ["Misapplication" example](misapplication-example.md)
  from one of my (NK) Flora of Australia treatments, to illustrate the discussion
  we had in the second meeting yesterday (2019-03-06) about what exactly is a
  Taxonomic Name Usage and whether a misapplication assertion constitutes a new
  TNU, like a synonym assertion does (or at least one of the participants'
  standpoint).

  The example caused a bit of an email discussion, which has been included, and
  sparked off a discussion about homotypic and heterotypic synonyms.

- [Homotypic and heterotypic synonym discussion](homotypic-heterotypic-examples.md).
  This discussion came forth from the discussion about what relationships are new
  TNUs and which ones aren't.

- [Protonym discussion](protonym.md). Continued from the discussion in the issues
  [#32](https://github.com/tdwg/tnc/issues/32) and
  [#34](https://github.com/tdwg/tnc/issues/34).
