# Examples

This folder will be used to collate examples to illustrate how taxonomic data is
dealt with in different scenarios. This will be rather messy in the beginning,
but we'll clean it up and make it more consistent as we go.

## Index

- [NSL instance graph example](https://github.com/tdwg/tnc/blob/master/TDWG2018/nsl-instancegraph-example.pdf)

- ["Misapplication" example](lembophyllum_divulsum_misapplication_example.pdf)
  from one of my (NK) Flora of Australia treatments, to illustrate the discussion
  we had in the second meeting yesterday (2019-03-06) about what exactly is a
  Taxonomic Name Usage and whether a misapplication assertion constitutes a new
  TNU, like a synonym assertion does (or at least one of the participants'
  standpoint). Two things that should be noted:

  - To me misapplications are not really a thing that should be dealt with. They
    are nasty shortcuts that cover up relationships between taxonomic
    concepts (or are just misidentifications and should be dealt with at the
    specimen level)

  - It doesn't really matter how, or whether, we deal with synonyms and
    misapplications, as it is only the accepted (by their authors) name usages
    that can be used to model taxa. Synonyms and misapplications are only about
    disposition of names.
