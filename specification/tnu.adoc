* TCS also has a `DataSet/TaxonNames/TaxonName/CanonicalName` where the name is
  split up into its constituent parts. I [NK] think this probably shouldn't be

  than the name. Or can we leave it out altogether and consider it part of the name
  (and the mapping to a rank in the vocabulary as a spelling correction
  [or other relationship]) [NK, 2018-11-13]

.Discussion
* TCS uses MicroReference in a number of places, including in the TaxonName
  class. I think all the bits in the TaxonName class where this applies to
  have been moved into the TaxonomicNameUsage class, but we are still going
  to need micro references in the TaxonConceptRelationship class. Would it be
  useful to have a Reference that comprises a Publication (or
  BibliographicResource) and a micro reference? (I probably wouldn't use it in a
  database, but would in JSON) [NK, 2018-11-12]
* We should be able to find something in some citation standard that covers this
  (haven't been successful so far). [NK, 2018-11-13]

.Discussion
* I propose to replace the TCS `primary` (`DataSet/TaxonConcepts/TaxonConcept/@primary`)
  attribute with a `type` property. This allows for a vocabulary with just '`primary`'
  and '`secondary`', basically corresponding to the boolean in TCS, or a more
  detailed Taxonomic Name Usage Type vocabulary. [NK, 2018-11-12]

  according to the business rules of the code. It requires no taxonomic opinion.

2+a|

.Discussion
- In TCS `PublicationStatus` is a NomenclaturalNoteType (complexType with
  several sub-elements), which allows for a lot of detail, but is not so great
  for searching and linking etc. We should have a vocabulary on this term and
  deal with the detail in the vocabulary. Rules (or their numbering) tend to
  change between consecutive issues of a Code. [NK, 2018-11-12]
- In the TDWG Taxon Name LSID Ontology, {tn}PublicationStatus[tn:PublicationStatus]
  is a {tn}NomenclaturalNoteTypeTerm[tn:NomenclaturalNoteTypeTerm]. There is no
  property in {voc}TaxonName[TaxonName] that links a {tn}NomenclaturalNote[tn:NomenclaturalNote] to a
  {voc}TaxonName[TaxonName], but {tn}NomenclaturalNote[tn:NomenclaturalNote]
  has a {tn}subjectTaxonName[tn:subjectTaxonName] property that does it the other
  way around. [NK, 2018-11-13]
- Should this also be moved to TaxonomicNameUsage? [NK, 2018-11-12]

* Not in TCS or in the TDWG Taxon Concept Ontology (because TCS taxon concepts
  are always 'accepted'?), but in Darwin Core and Berlin Model. NSL has this as
  part of their Instance type. [NK, 2018-11-13]

.Discussion
* It might be better to leave this out of the specification, but implementations
  will need to have a repeatable typification element that contains the
  typeOfType and typeSpecimen properties. [NK, 2018-11-12]
* Lecto- and Neotypifications are TNUs. Does this mean that Typification is
  better moved to the TaxonomicNameUsage class? (I think I'd like that; so much
  so that I went ahead and did it) [NK, 2018-11-12]

  think this is the same as the __Fact__s in the Berlin Model (or MoReTax). Good
  to have as an attachment point for traits? [NK, 2018-11-12]

  `TaxonRelationshipAssertions`. When under `TaxonConcepts` there is obviously
  no `FromTaxonConcept`, as that is the `TaxonConcept` the `Relationship` sits
  within itself.
